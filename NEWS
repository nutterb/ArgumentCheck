### 0.10.0 (10 July 2015)
* `addError`, `addWarning`, and `addMessage` will no longer carry the `expr` argument.
* List objects are no longer used for the buffer.  Only environments are used.
* Addition of `match_arg` an analog to (in fact, a copy of) `match.arg`.  
  When `match_arg` fails, the first option in the `choices` argument is retained.  
  If appropriate, this may be used to allow further argument checking while still using 
  the `match.arg` approach to choosing an option.

### 0.9.2 (4 July 2015)
* Reversing some previous changes to allow lists or 
  environments to be used for the buffer.  The 
  environment has an interesting side effect where
  it can be accessed by other functions nested within
  a function, potentially giving the ability to 
  capture all of the checks from a series of nested
  functions.  This list won't accept this interaction.
  I figured having the option here couldn't hurt.

### 0.9.1 (30 June 2015)
* Adds tests
* Adds `addMessage`
* Changes the buffer to an environment

### 0.9 (1 June 2015)

* Initial Release includes the following functions:
  * `newArgCheck`
  * `addError`
  * `addWarning`
  * `finishArgCheck`
