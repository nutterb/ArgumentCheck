Title: Improved Communication to Users with Respect to Problems in Function
    Arguments.

Description: The typical process of checking arguments in functions is
    iterative.  In this process, an error may be returned and the user may fix
    it only to receive another error on a different argument.  'ParameterCheck
    'facilitates a more helpful way to perform argument checks allowing the
    programmer to run all of the checks and then return all of the errors and
    warnings in a single message.
